Over the last few weeks I've been playing with the Agon Light 2.  It's a great little 8Bit retro computer that uses a eZ80 as it's CPU.

I've built the EIGHTSBITWIDE Arcade board for it so I can use game controllers with it. It's a neat little PCB that uses ten 10kOhm resistors, two 9-pin angled D-Sub connectors and the 34-pin connector that the Agon Light 2 uses.  It's a really nice easy build which I was grateful for as I've not soldered for a couple of years.

If you want to buy a one pre-assembled, you can get one direct from the boards [creator PCBWay site](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Agon_ARCADE_Joystick_Interface_893b9d84.html).
