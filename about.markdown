Hi, Iâ€™m @andymccall

I'm an geek who has worked on infrastructure and software development in various industries across the North West of the United Kingdom.

I'm passionate about retro computers such as the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, Amiga and Atari ST and neo-retro computers like the ZX Spectrum Next, Commander X16, Agon Light 2 and NEO6502. I enjoy repairing and building build peripherals for them. I programming in Pascal, C/C++ and Java and over the last year I've been learning assembly language for the Z80 and 6502.

I don't write code, documents or software for profit, I do it for enjoyment and to help others. If you get anything useful from my repositories, please let me know by buying me a coffee using my Ko-fi tip page [here](https://ko-fi.com/andymccall
