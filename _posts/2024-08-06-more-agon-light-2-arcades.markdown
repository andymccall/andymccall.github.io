In the last few weeks I'd made my first order from [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/).  This order consisted of some Amstrad CPC PCB's and a bulk order of some Agon Light 2 Arcade boards. I've decided to build a batch of them and sell them at cost on the [Agon Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/agoncomputer/).  Hopefully this will encourage more developers to support this board for games.  Before I ordered them I checked with EIGHTBITSWIDE to see if he was happy with me doing this over Discord and he had no issues at all, from his perspective the more boards that are in use the more support they will get.

I ordered them in black with white text and I think they look really nice.  When built and costed, they should cost around Â£17 each excluding postage costs.  Hopefully I can sell them and use the money to build some other things.
