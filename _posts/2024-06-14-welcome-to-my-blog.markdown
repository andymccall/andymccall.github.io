I've finally made some time and created a new blog. I've done this for a few reasons. Firstly, I've been learning assembly and revisiting C on some neo-retro systems such as the Agon Light 2, NEO6502 and the Commander X16 and I wanted to write up some of my experiences so others can hopefully save some time.  I've also been going through the backlog of retro machines and restoring them and I wanted to document this too. I don't really expect anyone to read this blog. It's more of a personal write up to help me organise my thoughts and hopefully be more disciplined.
